This project was a coding test of a bubble chart a visualization.

### Strategy assessment

#### The way of creating dashboard

I think there are two main steps to create a dashboard for data analyzing. Data preparation and data visualization.

1. Data preparation

Getting the raw data and deal with it according to analyzing goal. The result we get from this step that the data is ready for rendering without any complicated calculation. For this project, I create method to aggregate data.

2. Data visualization

Show your data with a clear and easy reading way. The key points in this step are how to show data in an easy reading way, and how to make the data and chart are interactive. For this project, I choose "Victory" package as render tool. It provides nearly all kinds of charts we used normally. 

#### The suggestions of data visualization

I think the final goal for data visualization is to help customer and company make decision. 

The key part about it is data analytical model. The general tool or language I know are R and Python. R provides lots of integrated packages and could be used directly. The drawback is all data are stored in cache. It means data processing ability is limited. Python provides numpy, pandas framwork. They are always used for data clean and dat modeling.

Data visualization, I would like to recommend PowerBI. It is easy to use. And the chart do not need to be complex. One chart show one idea is enough. A good model is always in a simple form in my mind.
